            It all started with a hardcore foodie’s urge to get the best taste rolling on his tongue in everything that he eats.
              Navneet Sajwan, founder director of Kathi Junction has always been on a lookout for delicious and mouth-watering comfort food from his school days.
              Kathi Junction is a live example of how this habit turned a strong foodaholic into an entrepreneur.
              One day in 2009, an intention to get into the rapidly propagating food industry gave birth to the idea of opening a fast food store.
              Then began the search for a lip smacking product and after an extensive research, “Kathi Roll” was singled out.              
              A Kathi Roll has been known to be conceptualised way back in the British era when people wanted to grab a bite of some tasty food while on a go.
              With time, the product passed on in the hands of chefs from various locations and kept on improving.
              An entrepreneur’s USP is always his desire to expand and never stop.</p>
